Social Impact Statement

Team OvenHouse received a comment during the architecture review that struck at the heart of ethical ramifications of releasing OvenHouse in its current state. Namely, our characters were all gender conforming and white. Our social statement is oriented around this comment. While at the time it felt natural, we didn’t have any conversations for or to the contrary, in hindsight we understand how this design decision can impact users. 

“Why is the witch female? That seems sexist. Is your group trying to perpetuate an image of females as villains? Or worse is your group trying to signal to young boys around the world that they can't be witches, only wizards? I'd like to see your group challenge gender stereotypes by making the witch male or non-gender conforming Also I noticed that all of the characters on your slide were white. People of color are notoriously underrepresented in video games and with this project you have the opportunity to address that. This should be a game that people of all races can enjoy and feel represented by.”

In order to mitigate our risk going forward we made all characters non-gender conforming and non-racial. For unrelated risks we plan to have students review our final product before EXPO day looking for social complications.
