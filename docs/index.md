## Project Description 

This is a game that creates a suspenseful experience for the player. It is based off of the Grimm Fairy Tale *Hansel and Gretel*.

The goal of this game is to reintroduce fairy tales and folk traditions to the next generation in a modern style; to keep us connected with our past while modifying it so that it fits the current trend.

[//]: # (TODO: one sentence about the design decisions/artwork that we made)
The artwork in this game heavily uses the colors black and white to achieve two goals: creating a chilling atmophsere and avoiding insinuations about race and skin color. The vivid colors apart from black and white are meant to project a magical feeling as the player is captured by the witch and the only light they can see is what is given to them by the witch.
