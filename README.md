# OvenHouse!

## Project Description 

Welcome to the OvenHouse repository. This is a game that creates a suspensful experience for the player. It is based off of the Grimm Fairy Tale *Hansel and Gretel*.

The goal of this game is to reintroduce fairy tales and folk traditions to the next generation in a modern style; to keep us connected with our past while modifying it so that it fits the current trend.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
